/* Step 1: Declare a Variable
"Every variable in C++ must be declared before it can be used!"
Suppose we are building a game and we want to keep track of a player’s score that goes from 0 to 10. We need a variable!

Before we can use a variable, we must declare, or create, it. To declare a variable, we need to provide two things:

A type for the variable.
A name for the variable.

int score;
The int is the type of the variable.
The score is the name of the variable.
The ; is how we end a statement.

In C++, variable names consist only of upper/lower case letters, digits, and/or underscores.

Note: C++ is known as a strongly typed language. If you try to give an integer value a decimal number, you are going to get unexpected results, warnings, or errors.

/*

#include <iostream>

int main() 
{

  // Declare a variable
  int score;
  int year;
  
}

/* Step 2: Initialize a Variable
After we declare a variable, we can give it a value!

Suppose that we have declared an int variable called score, to set it to 0, we can simply write:

score = 0;
The score is the name of the variable.
The = indicates assignment.
The 0 is the value you want to store inside the variable.
Note: In C++, a single equal sign = does not really mean “equal”. It means “assign”. In the code above, we are assigning the score variable a value of 0.

/*

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  
  // Declare a variable   
  int year;
  year = 2019;
  // Initialize a variable
  
   
}

/*
Combining Step 1 and Step 2
We can both declare and assign a value to a variable in a single initialization statement.

Suppose we have these two lines:

// Declare a variable
int score;
 
// Initialize a variable
score = 0;
We can actually combine these two lines into a single line of code:

int score = 0;
This means we are declaring an integer called score and setting it equal to 0.

Note: We only need to declare a variable one time! 
And it is highly suggested to initialize a variable before using it later.*/

#include <iostream>

int main() {

   int score = 0;
   int year = 2019;
   // Declare and initialize a variable here
   
   
   return 0;
   
}

/*
Arithmetic Operators
Computers are incredible at doing calculations. Now that we have declared variables, let’s use them with arithmetic operators to calculate things!

Here are some arithmetic operators:

+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
% modulo (divides and gives the remainder)
For example:

int score = 0;
// score is 0
 
score = 4 + 2;
// it is now 6
 
score = 4 - 2;
// it is now 2
 
score = 4 * 2;
// it is now 8
 
score = 4 / 2;
// and now 2
 
score = 5 % 2;
// and now 1
Note: The order of operations can be specified using parentheses. 
For example, the use of parentheses in score = 5 * (4 + 3) sets score equal to 5 * 7 rather than 20 + 3.
*/

#include <iostream>

int main() {

  int score = 0;
  score = 1234*99;
  //You can output the value by simply adding this code underneath:
  std::cout << score << "\n";
  //Notice how when we want to output a variable, we don’t add double quotes around its name.


  
  
  


}
